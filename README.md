I am Keegan Freeman, a Master of Science in Data Science student attending the University of Washington, and Computer Engineering Graduate from the University of Houston (highest honors). I have a special interest towards machine learning and artificial intelligence and plan on them being the cornerstone of my career later in life. To satisfy my undergraduate honors requirements I recently completed an honors thesis at the University of Houston utilizing augmented intelligence, an alteration of artificial intelligence, to predict the likelihood of students dropping a course based on their education, familial, job, and miscellaneous influences. I have experience with microcontroller hardware, programming, technical writing, and being on an engineering team. I am a mellow individual that loves to make jokes and put a positive spin on most situations. I consider myself somewhat of a renaissance man as I enjoy the arts, literature, engineering, theatre, education, fitness, playing music, computer science, and Dungeons & Dragons.
